7. find the second highest sal for person with different department in department wise collection
 
8. there is million of records is their which collection you will be prefer and why
Ans
---
Are you going to be doing many inserts with no sorting? Linked List
Are you going to be doing a lot of lookups? HashMap/Dictionary
Are you going to just have an unordered group of things? List and/or Array
Do you not want duplicates? Set
Do you not want duplicates, but want a fast lookup? HashSet
Do you have an ordered List that is to be sorted by keys? TreeMap
 
9. selection sort
 
10. what happen if hash equal override as true

11. a.data strucuture to sort the huge employee object based on id and id should be unique
   b.why we should not use treeSet sorting the employee object
   c.when im entering into the employee object into collection it should should be sorted internally how will you do it
   
12. which collection object is stores unique object and sorted format

13. can we able to run the spring boot application without any server including embedded tomat server we should not use.

14. what are all the properties we have pass inside the @Transactional annotation

15. a.we have the controller that receiveing two object, these two i need to store in a two different database. in this case how you will manage the transaction. 
   b.if my first db call gets failed how will you initiate the transaction for the second db call and how will you prioritize the transaction.
   
   
1.Assume an Employee class with fields id,name,salary using the Stream API to get the name of employees with a salary greater than 20000
2.What are different sorting technique. write the code for selection sort.
3.Write a code Employee class with Id,firstName,lastName and override equals() in same class. then create employee object and put this in hashMap object.
now analyse how many object has created. based on this they asked
a)can we only overide equals() method.
b)can we only override hashCode() method;
c)in this case override equals() and made true for all objects.what will be the output.

22/07 (Garud Prashant)
----------------
Round 1 :
Write a program which gives user 2 options
1.Enter a name
2.Display a name
This should run in a loop
when user gives input 1:
Code should prompt "Enter name"
when user gives input 2:
Code should return the last entered name and it should be deleted.
Should implement it in stack implementation using arrays but not using Stack collection.
 
Edge case:
1. for input 1,if index greater than length of stack print message "Cannot enter name"
2.for input 2,if index less 0 than print message "No names to display"

22/07 (Asked by Sayee)
---------------------

-Write Insertion sort
Basically asked to write program to move biggest number to left until given array is sorted.
-Given an integer array, write program to reverse them (basically sort)

1.Take some random noâ€™s and then find  duplicates  by using stream api.
2.Write test case for this and by using mckito.
3.If you hv .csv file or you want to generate any report how to create such  frame work for this use case.
4.For the above use case what kind of database will you choose?
5.From monolithic application , if you want to transform such use case what will be your thoughts and how to make such frame work..
6.How did you process above scenario?
7.Hw do you generate millions of records or millions of such files and strore in db?

----------------------
5 teams, each team has five members, all the the members have different ratings, you need to find out one player from each team with max rating and have a match. Do it in team1 and team2 and again same thing from team3 and team4..and now winner of team 1 and 2 , and winner of team 3 and 4, will have a match, whose ratings will be better, he wins

Core Java
=================================>
1) equals and hashcode  contract
2) explain it with the help of hashmap
3) In employee class if hashcode is always returing 1 then what will be happen if I put two employee objects of same content in a hashmap-- scenario based few more questions on size of the map and key and values in the map object 
4) thread questions like executor service, thread pooling
5) diffrence between future and completable future and advantages disadvantages 
6) diffrence between execute and submit and invoke all.
7) Thread scneraio based like clubbing the outputs of ten futures
8) Synchronization questions & Volatile keyword
9) diffrence bewteen hashmap and concurrent hashmap and asking scenario like in which  scnerio we go with both maps -> synchronization and locking mechaninsims on both maps like that 
10) checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions -- > this was asked while dealing with threads(Intrepted exception) and collection (concurrent modifications exception and how to avoid it)
 
Java Stream Programming questions 
=================================>
 
Employee Object having department and age we need to filter the list of employee having age >30 and then group by department name
 
Asking about explanantion of program that we have written  and few follow up questions
 
 
Spring Boot 
===========>
1) Transaction propagation & isolation levels on backend
2) exclude configuartion
 
SQL
========>
 
1)InnerJoin on two tables having join cloumn employee and department
 
2)clubb the two resultsets having the identical columns --> UNIOINS
 
AWS
============>
 
1) Dynatrace monitoring , trace the request end to end
 
2)Explain Cloud watch & ECS Service advantages of having these
 
3) Jenkins questions like work flow --> git -> maven build -> sonarqube --> Testing--> dockerfile -> image building --> ECS service registry -> deploying images to ecs --> ecs start
 
4) deoployment pattren -> blue green deployment pattren

-----------
1. What happens when we override hashcode method in employee class and always return 1. How many entries would be created in the has map if we use employee object as key and try to insert elements
2. In the above scenario what happens when the employee class is immutable
3. How can we create a custom immutable class
4. Few questions on threads
5. In an array of integers fFind the number which is repeated the same number of times
